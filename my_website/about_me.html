    <h1 class="fontformat">About Me</h1> <!--Title-->
    <p class="fontformat">My name is Christopher Milligan. Iâ€™m from Bonnyrigg, just outside of Edinburgh,
      and I lived there until I was 10. I moved house several times to various nearby towns and finally
      lived in Gorebridge. I moved to Dundee when I was 17 to study Games Design and Production Management
      at Abertay University. After I completed my course I moved to Girona in Spain where I taught English.
      I lived there for 9 months before moving back to Scotland and found a flat in Edinburgh city centre.
      I worked at Lloyds bank as a Technical Customer Advisor for 3 years before deciding to pursue a career
      as a coder.<br><br>My hobbies include playing video games, listening to music, producing music and
      record collecting.</p> <!--Paragraph-->
