    <p class="fontformat">When I was a child I received a PS1 for Christmas and from that point I wanted to
      work in games. I worked out a path in high school in order to pass the subjects I needed to study
      games in university. Although I enjoyed studying games at university I quickly learnt that the video
      game industry can be difficult for a designer or manager to break into and that behind the scenes there
      are many challenges. I still design games and code games as a hobby but I would be more inclined to independently
      release any games I make instead of joining an existing games company.<br><br>My proudest moment in university
      was creating an audio game as my final project along side my dissertation. I hoped to open games up to those that
      are visually impaired and also start a discussion about the use of audio in video games as a tool for gameplay.<br><br>
      Below is a video of the soundtrack I made for the game.</p> <!--Paragraph-->
